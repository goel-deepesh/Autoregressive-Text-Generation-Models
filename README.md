# Autoregressive-Text-Generation-Models
Developed a k-gram text generation model with a fallback mechanism to smaller k-grams, balancing originality and coherence while reducing excessive copying. Analyzed longest common substring (LCS) length, demonstrating reduced copying and improved coherence- originality trade-offs through visualizations.
